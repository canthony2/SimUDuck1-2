 * SimUDuck Version 2. The executives of the game development company 
 * decided that flying ducks is just what the SimUDuck simulator game needed 
 * to blow away the competition. So Joe figured he just needed to add a fly() 
 * method in the Duck superclass and then all the ducks will inherit it. 
 * Joe was very proud of himself for being a true OOP genius.
